const supabaseUrl = 'https://skzirkhzwhyqmnfyytcl.supabase.co';
const supabaseAnonKey = 'eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...';
```
**Impact:** Toàn bộ database có thể bị compromise  
**Fix:** Move to environment variables immediately

#### 1.2 CORS Misconfiguration
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Location:** Multiple Supabase functions
```typescript
const corsHeaders = {
  'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*', // Allows any domain
};
```
**Impact:** XSS, CSRF attacks possible  
**Fix:** Restrict to specific domains

#### 1.3 Payment System Vulnerabilities
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Location:** `supabase/functions/create-payment/index.ts`

#### 1.4 Authentication Bypass
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Location:** `backend/trpc/create-context.ts:27-28`
```typescript
// For development, always return mock user
const user = mockUser;
```
**Impact:** Anyone can access protected resources  
**Fix:** Implement proper JWT validation

tournament.participants.forEach(...) // participants might be undefined
```

### 🟡 CODE QUALITY ISSUES

#### 4.4 Code Duplication
- Tournament card rendering duplicated 3 times
